# Jonathan Schäfer
I'm Jonathan Schäfer from Rheinland-Pfalz, Germany and interested in programming 

Currently, I focus on Optimisation problems, specifically Linear Optimisation problems as the tools are mighty, yet hardly used because of a lack of awareness.
  - [Here are some samples of this]


### I am proficient in (by descending order)

  - Verilog

### Currently learning
