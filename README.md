# Jonathan Schäfer
I'm Jonathan Schäfer from Rheinland-Pfalz, Germany and interested in informatics, chemistry and mathematics.

Currently, I am working on optimization problems, specifically linear and quadratic optimization problems ([sample problems]). As part of this I am in the process of building an independent solver for mixed-integer quadratic programming, leveraging branch-and-cut as well as the active set method.



### I am proficient in
  - F#
  - C#

### Currently learning
  - C++
  - Verilog
